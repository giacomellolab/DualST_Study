## Data availability
The list of SARS-CoV-2 genes targeted by the probes in this study and used in the data analysis can be found in this [csv file](data/covid_genes.csv).
The sample IDs for corresponding count matrices can be accessed [here](data/sampleID-counts-foldermapping.txt).

The counts can be accessed here.
Corresponding sequences fastq files can be accessed upon request from here.
High-resolution tissue images can be downloaded from here.

## Code used of the data analysis
Scripts used for generating count matrices can be accessed under [spaceranger-scripts](spaceranger-scripts/) folder.

All R scripts used to run the analysis can be found in sequential order ("<#>_filename.Rmd") under folder [R_scripts](R_scripts/).
The metadata used in the [1_add_metadata.Rmd](R_scripts/1_add_metadata.Rmd) is within this [sheet](data/covidlung_metadata.xlsx).
